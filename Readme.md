## I'm sorry, Perwadhoka what??

"Perwadhoka High School Score Database" is a program developed by a Data Scientist wannabe, Aqli. The purpose is to help schools store their student's data(s) on a more compacted environment. The reason why the programmer chose python languange is for its flexibility, lightweight program compared to others (e.g. Microsoft Excel) and is one of the simplest form of programming language compared to some others. This program offers four features of CRUD (create, read, update, delete) :

1. **Read records**, This program has 2 modes in reading. It could display the entire data that exists in the database, OR it can show a specific data the user want to display depending on the student's ID searched for.
2. **Add records**, The add record functions as a feature to create new data(s) that can be done through running the program itself instead of editing the database file.
3. **Update records**, This function enables user to modify and manipulate any specified student's data to its desired display output.
4. **Delete records**, By using delete record feature, user can completely remove any data existing on the database if user wished to do so.
